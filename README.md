## Introduction
Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to understand the purchase behavior of customers by analyzing the items they buy together. This code provides a tool for conducting market basket analysis and gaining insights from transactional data.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

-Python 3.x
-Pandas
-NumPy
-mlxtend (for association rule mining)
## Installation
Make sure you have Python installed. If not, download and install it from Python's official website.

-Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/Dhaneesh456/market-basket-insights.git
-Install the required Python packages:'pip install pandas numpy mlxtend'


## Usage
The main functionality of this code is to perform market basket analysis. To use the code, follow these steps:

Prepare your transactional data in a CSV format. The data should have columns representing transactions and the items bought in each transaction.
Use the provided Python script to conduct market basket analysis by providing the path to your transaction data.

## Example
python
Copy code
from market_basket_analysis import market_basket_analysis
## Load your transaction data
data = pd.read_csv('path/to/your/data.csv')

## Perform market basket analysis
results = market_basket_analysis(data)
print(results)
